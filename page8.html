                <blockquote><p><strong>FACTS&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>In May 1923, the building located at No. 124 Calle Arzobispo, City of Manila, was used by an organization known as the Parliamentary Club. Jose Ma Veloso was at that time a member of the House of Representatives of the Philippine Legislature. He was also the manager of the club.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>The police of Manila had reliable information that the so-called Parliamentary Club was nothing more than a gambling house. Indeed, on May 19, 1923, J. F. Townsend, the chief of the gambling squad, had been to the club and verified this fact.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>As a result, Detective Andres Geronimo of the secret service of the City of Manila, applied for, and obtained a search warrant from Judge Garduño of the municipal court. Thus provided, the police attempted to raid the Parliamentary Club a little after three in the afternoon of the same date. Once inside the Parliamentary Club, nearly fifty persons were apprehended by the police. One of them was the defendant Veloso.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Veloso asked Townsend what he wanted and the latter showed him the search warrant. Veloso read it and told Townsend that he was Representative Veloso and not John Doe, and that the police had no right to search the house. Townsend answered that Veloso was considered as John Doe.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>As Veloso’s pocket was bulging, as if it contained gambling utensils, Townsend required Veloso to show him the evidence of the game. About five minutes was consumed in conversation between the policemen and the accused, the policemen insisting on searching Veloso, and Veloso insisting in his refusal to submit to the search. At last the patience of the officers was exhausted. So policeman Rosacker took hold of Veloso only to meet with his resistance. Veloso bit Rosacker on the right forearm, and gave him a blow in another part of the body, which injured the policeman quite severely. Through the combined efforts of Townsend and Rosacker, Veloso was finally laid down on the floor, and long sheets of paper, or reglas de monte, cards, cardboards, and chips were taken from his pockets.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>All of the persons arrested were searched and then conducted to the patrol wagons. Veloso again refused to obey and shouted offensive epithets against the police department It was necessary for the policemen to conduct him downstairs. At the door, Veloso resisted so tenaciously that three policemen were needed to place him in the patrol wagon.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>In the municipal court of the City of Manila, the persons arrested in the raid were accused of gambling. All of them were eventually acquitted in the Court of First Instance for lack of proof, with the sole exception of Veloso, who was found guilty of maintaining a gambling house.

                <blockquote><p><strong>HELD</strong></p><p><strong>An excerpt from the warrant:
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Proof by affidavit having this day been made before me by Andres Geronimo that he has good reason to believe and does believe that John Doe has illegally in his possession in the building occupied by him and which is under his control, namely in the building numbered 124 Calle Arzobispo, City of Manila, Philippine Islands, certain devices and effects used in violation of the Gambling Law xxx
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>A search warrant must conform strictly to the requirements of the constitutional and statutory provisions under which it is issued. Otherwise, it is void. No presumptions of regularity are to be invoked in aid of the process when an officer undertakes to justify under it.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>A warrant for the apprehension of a person whose true name is unknown, by the name of ‘John Doe’ or ‘Richard Roe’, whose other or true name is unknown is void, without other and further descriptions of the person to be apprehended, and such warrant will not justify the officer in acting under it.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Such a warrant must, in addition, contain the best descriptio personae possible to be obtained of the person or persons to be apprehended, and this description must be sufficient to indicate clearly the proper person or persons upon whom the warrant is to be served; and should state his personal appearance and peculiarities, give his occupation and place of residence, and any other circumstances by means of which he can be identified.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>In the first place, the affidavit for the search warrant and the search warrant itself described the building to be searched as “the building No. 124 Calle Arzobispo, City of Manila, Philippine Islands.” This, without doubt, was a sufficient designation of the premises to be searched.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>The Organic Act requires a particular description of the place to be searched, and the person or things to be seized, and that the warrant in this case sufficiently described the place and the gambling apparatus, and, in addition, contained a description of the person to be seized.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Under the authorities cited by the appellant, it is invariably recognized that the warrant for the apprehension of an unnamed party is void, “except in those cases where it contains a descriptio personae such as will enable the officer to identify the accused.” The description must be sufficient to indicate clearly the proper person upon whom the warrant is to be served.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>As the search warrant stated that John Doe had gambling apparatus in his possession in the building occupied by him at No. 124 Calle Arzobispo, City of Manila, and as this John Doe was Jose Ma. Veloso, the manager of the club, the police could identify John Doe as Jose Ma. Veloso without difficulty.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><a href="page10.html">SOURCES</a></strong></p></blockquote>
